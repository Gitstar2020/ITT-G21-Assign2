My name is Patrick Mamigonian (RMIT Student#:S3858848) and I live in Sydney, NSW.  My earlier studies and career were in Mechanical Engineering however soon after transitioned to IT which I found very similar in solution design, delivery, and problem solving.  I have now worked in IT for around 20 years and fortunate to have exposure in roles ranging from Service Desk Operations, Systems Admin, B.A and application development, and Project and Team Management.  The last 8 years I have managed the ICT stream in a number of M&A’s, worked in digital transformation teams, and more recently had the opportunity to take a regional role as Head of APAC ICT for a multinational organisation.  I am married with 3 children and enjoy learning, challenging projects, poliltics, music, drumming and motorcycles.
